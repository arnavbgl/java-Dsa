public static void main


public (Access Modifier)
---This means the method is accessible from anywhere.
---Since Java programs start execution from main(), it must be public so the JVM can access it.

main:-
---It is the entry point of the function 
---This is the standard method name where Java starts execution.
---If you change this name, Java wonâ€™t recognize it as the entry point.

static:- 
---static means this method belongs to the class itself, not an instance 
---Agar main() static na hota, toh JVM ko pehle class ka object banana padta, jo unnecessary aur confusing hota.

void:-
---This means the method does not return any value.
---main() is only meant to execute code, not return results.

FUNCTION:-
--- Syntax => Static void Function_name(){
    body
}
--- if return write in function function will be finish at that point and never execute the code which is written after return statement in the function.
--- return statement shuld bo only in those function which have return type not VOID.
